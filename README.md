# simple-websocket-externalData
This an improved version of the simple-websocket-setup project. The aim is to demonstrate the use of an independent signal source.


## The Data Writer ##
This tiny script is responsible for generating a mock JSON file stream that is saved
and constantly updated inside a `./data/object.json` file. The purpose here is
mimicing an independent data stream that can be anything: data coming from an
exchange, a sensor reading, anything.
